    \subsection{Custom score functions}\label{custom-score-functions}

    In this version of Isolation, the player whose turn it is when both
pieces are on squares of the same color has an advantage. The reason is
that whenever there is a square that both players can reach (which means
that they are both on a square of the opposite color), this player moves
first. If moving to this square is good, the player can not only reach a
good square, but he can also prevent his opponent from reaching a good
square. The following position illustrates this.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{heuristic_analysis_example.png}
\caption{White to move}
\end{figure}

Here (4, 6) is a good square. From there a few more moves along the
bottom of the board will be available. As it is White's turn, he can
move to this square, thus preventing Black from moving there.

In the following we call the player who has this advantage the
\emph{attacker}, and we call his opponent the \emph{defender}. In
general, a position where both players compete for the same squares
favors the attacker. If the possible moves for both players do not
overlap, the attacker's advantage is neutralized. custom\_score\_2 makes
use of this observation.

\textbf{custom\_score\_2:} This heuristic increases the value from
improved\_score by 3 if there is a square which can be reached by both
players in the next move. The value 3 was found by experimenting. This
score function is about as good as improved\_score.

\textbf{custom\_score\_3:} The score functions from the lecture and
custom\_score\_2 only look at the squares that each player can reach in
the next move. This function looks at the squares that each player can
reach in the next \(k\) moves (for some \(k \geq 2\)). We write
\(s_k(p)\) for the number of squares that the player \(p\) can reach in
the next \(k\) moves. Then custom\_score\_3 is calculated as

\[s_k(player) - s_k(opponent)\]

It turns out that 2 and 3 work best as values for \(k\). In the
implementation \(k = 2\) is used. This score function takes more time
than the functions from the lecture and custom\_score\_2. It performs
worse than improved\_score.

\textbf{custom\_score:} This score function combines the ideas from
custom\_score\_2 and custom\_score\_3. We write \(s_k(both)\) for the
number of squares that can be reached by both players in the next \(k\)
moves. As the attacker wants to reach a position where both players
compete for the same squares and the defender wants to avoid this, we
define the score function as

\[s_k(player) - s_k(opponent) + c \cdot s_k(both)\]

if \(player\) is the attacker and

\[s_k(player) - s_k(opponent) - c \cdot s_k(both)\]

if \(player\) is the defender.

\(c\) is a constant value. After experimenting with different values for
\(k\) and \(c\) I chose \(k = 2\) and \(c = 0.5\).

Although custom\_score takes more time than the score functions from the
lecture, it performs slightly better.

    \subsection{Tournament results}\label{tournament-results}

    As a final test of the score functions, I used tournament.py to compare
them. The opponents that are used for the comparison are AB\_Open
(Alphabeta with open\_score), AB\_Improved (Alphabeta with
improved\_score), MM\_Improved (Minimax with improved\_score), and
MonteCarlo (a Monte Carlo search tree agent that I implemented).

The test agents consist of one agent for each of my custom score
functions, and AB\_Impr to allow a direct comparison with the custom
score functions. The agent named 'Custom' is an improved version of the
alpha-beta algorithm that uses the same score function as AB\_Custom.
Custom implements a suggestion from the AIMA book: in each iteration
step, the move that appeared best in the last step is considered first.
Thus more branches can be pruned by the alpha-beta algorithm.

Here are the match results:
 Match #   Opponent     AB_Custom   AB_Custom_2  AB_Custom_3    Custom     AB_Improved
                        Won | Lost   Won | Lost   Won | Lost   Won | Lost   Won | Lost 
    1       AB_Open     59  |  41    58  |  42    55  |  45    67  |  33    51  |  49

    The results show that my custom evaluation function (AB\_Custom) is
stronger than the others (AB\_Custom\_2, AB\_Custom\_3, and
AB\_Improved). Improving the alpha-beta algorithm by reordering the
moves (Custom) yields even slightly better results.
