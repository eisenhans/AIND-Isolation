    \section*{\texorpdfstring{Research Review: Silver et al.,
\textbf{\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270}{Mastering the
game of Go without human knowledge}}
(2017)}{Silver et al., Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge (2017)}}\label{silver-et-al.-mastering-the-game-of-go-without-human-knowledge-2017}

    Because of its large search space, the game of Go is one of the hardest
board games. In 2016 DeepMind's AlphaGo program won a match against Lee
Sedol, one the world's strongest players. AlphaGo was described in
\textbf{\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961}{Mastering the
game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search}}. The paper that
we review here is about a new version of AlphaGo called AlphaGo Zero. It
is called Zero because it uses no knowledge about Go except the rules of
the game.\\

AlphaGo Zero consists of a deep neural network with more than 40 layers.
The network uses residual learning, a technique that helps training deep
neural networks invented by Microsoft in 2015. Technically, the network
is based on Google's TensorFlow. The network is trained with the results
from self-play. For self-play a version of Monte Carlo Tree search is
used.

    \subsubsection*{Self-play}\label{self-play}

The neural network can be viewed as a function \(f_\theta\) that accepts
a game position \(s\) as input and returns a tuple

\[f_\theta(s) = (\mathbf{p}, \mathit{v})\]

Thereby \(\mathbf{p}\) is a vector of move probabilities. For every
legal move from the given game position \(s\), \(\mathbf{p}\) contains
the probability that this move will be played. \(v\) is a value between
-1 and +1 that estimates the outcome of the game.\\

A simple approach for self-play would be to just choose a move according
to the move probabilities in \(\mathbf{p}\). But stronger play results
if the decision does not use \(\mathbf{p}\) directly, but a Monte Carlo
tree search (MCTS) that is based on \((\mathbf{p}, v)\). This version of
MCTS works as follows: first a node in the search tree is selected
(looking for a balance between exploration and exploitation). Then this
node is expanded, i.e. one of the moves is chosen according to the move
probabilities \(\mathbf{p}\) for that position. But unlike in standard
versions of MCTS, there is no simulation (playout) for the new node.
Instead the value \(\mathit{v}\) provided by the neural network is used
directly to evaluate the new position. Then the result is
back-propagated up to the root position. After 1.600 expansions the most
promising move is played.

    \subsubsection*{Training of the neural
network}\label{training-of-the-neural-network}

In every step of MCTS, the child nodes of the current root node are
assigned relative frequencies. We use the variable \(\mathbf{\pi}\) for
the vector of the move frequencies from position \(s\), and we use \(z\)
for the final outcome of the game (either +1 or -1). So we can compare
the values for \(f_\theta(s) = (\mathbf{p}, v)\) from the neural network
with the values \((\mathbf{\pi}, z)\) from the games. By updating the
parameters \(\theta\) of the neural network in such a way that the
difference between \((\mathbf{p}, v)\) and \((\mathbf{\pi}, z)\) gets
smaller, we obtain a new version of the network that has learned from
the self-play games. Each training iteration uses 25.000 games of
self-play as input.

    \subsubsection*{Differences to the previous AlphaGo
version}\label{differences-to-the-previous-alphago-version}

The most important difference is that AlphaGo Zero uses only
reinforcement learning, no supervised learning. Thus it is possible to
generalize their approach for use in other domains. In their new paper
\textbf{\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf}{Mastering Chess and
Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm}}
from December 2017 the authors describe an algorithm named AlphaZero
that does this with respect to the games of chess and shogi. AlphaZero
has beaten current world-class programs in both games.\\

AlphaGo Zero uses one neural network that computes both the move
probabilities \(\mathbf{p}\) and the position evaluations
\(\mathit{v}\). The previous version used two networks: a policy network
and a value network. The approach to use the value \(v\) from the
network directly for MCTS evaluation (rather than performing a rollout)
is also new.
